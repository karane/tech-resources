# Software Engineer vs Tech Lead

## Delivery Responsibilities Comparison

| Dimension | Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Primary focus** | Deliver assigned tasks correctly | Ensure the team delivers safely and predictably |
| **Core responsibility** | Own implementation | Own outcomes |
| **Success metric** | Task completed as specified | No surprises, system stable, team unblocked |
| **Main question asked** | “How do I implement this?” | “How do we deliver this safely?” |

---

## 1. Understanding the Task

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Clarifies scope for personal understanding | Clarifies scope for shared team understanding |
| Confirms requirements | Reframes the problem in simple language |
| Asks *“what exactly do I need to build?”* | Defines goals, non-goals, and success criteria |

---

## 2. Risk Identification

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Identifies risks in own task | Identifies risks across the whole delivery |
| Flags legacy, performance, or dependency risks | Prioritizes, mitigates, and sequences risks |
| Communicates risks when discovered | Actively hunts risks before work starts |

**Key difference**

> Engineer reports risks.  
> Tech Lead removes them.

## 3. Planning & Estimation

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Estimates own work conservatively | Shapes plan so work can move in parallel |
| Breaks task into personal steps | Breaks work across people and streams |
| Focuses on own deadline | Focuses on delivery predictability |

---

## 4. Execution

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Implements features | Enables others to implement |
| Writes clean, testable code | Reviews for system health and failure modes |
| Focuses on correctness | Focuses on correctness **and** operability |

---

## 5. Communication

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Sends daily status updates | Controls the delivery narrative |
| Reports progress and blockers | Translates progress into confidence |
| Communicates when blocked | Communicates before problems escalate |

---

## 6. Code Reviews

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Receives feedback | Sets quality bar |
| Fixes issues in own code | Reviews for maintainability and risk |
| Learns patterns | Enforces consistency and simplicity |

---

## 7. Quality Under Pressure

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Works harder to meet deadline | Trades scope, not safety |
| Focuses on finishing task | Protects tests, logging, rollback |
| Feels pressure | Absorbs pressure |

---

## 8. Delivery & Closure

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Marks task as done | Closes the loop explicitly |
| Shares PR or deployment info | Confirms system health post-delivery |
| Fixes follow-ups if asked | Monitors and stabilizes delivery |

---

## 9. Relationship with Manager

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Keeps manager informed | Reduces decisions manager must make |
| Escalates blockers | Prevents escalations |
| Delivers updates | Delivers confidence |

---

## Mental Models (Very Important)

### Software Engineer

> *“If I deliver cleanly and communicate early, trust follows.”*

### Tech Lead

> *“If the system is calm and predictable, delivery is working.”*

## Summary in One Sentence

**Software Engineer**  
Deliver your task clearly, safely, and predictably.

**Tech Lead**  
Make delivery boring — no surprises, no chaos, no drama.
