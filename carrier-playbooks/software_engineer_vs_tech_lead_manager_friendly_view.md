# Software Engineer vs Tech Lead
## Manager-Friendly Delivery View

This document highlights **what managers should expect** from a Software Engineer versus a Tech Lead during delivery. It focuses on outcomes, risk, and predictability rather than technical detail.

## At a Glance

| Area | Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|-----|------------------|-----------|
| **Primary accountability** | Individual tasks | Overall delivery |
| **Owns** | Code implementation | Delivery outcomes |
| **Optimizes for** | Correctness | Predictability and stability |
| **Measures success by** | Task completion | No surprises, smooth delivery |

## What Each Role Is Responsible For

### Software Engineer

Managers can expect a Software Engineer to:

- Deliver assigned work according to specification
- Raise risks or blockers when they appear
- Produce clean, testable, maintainable code
- Estimate and communicate progress on their own tasks
- Follow team standards and feedback

**Manager signal:**
> “My task is progressing as planned. Here are the risks I see.”

---

### Tech Lead

Managers can expect a Tech Lead to:

- Ensure the **entire team delivers predictably**
- Identify and mitigate risks *before* they become incidents
- Shape plans so work progresses in parallel
- Keep delivery calm, even under pressure
- Translate technical status into clear delivery confidence

**Manager signal:**
> “Delivery is on track. Risks are identified and under control.”

## Risk & Escalation Model

| Topic | Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Risk detection | Notices issues in own scope | Actively hunts systemic risks |
| Escalation | Flags problems when blocked | Prevents escalations by early action |
| Failure handling | Fixes issues when found | Ensures rollback, monitoring, and recovery |

**Key difference:**

> Engineers report risks.  
> Tech Leads absorb and neutralize them.

---

## Planning & Predictability

### Software Engineer

- Estimates their own work
- Focuses on meeting assigned deadlines
- Adjusts implementation details when needed

### Tech Lead

- Shapes plans to reduce uncertainty
- Trades scope instead of safety
- Protects timelines by managing dependencies

**Manager takeaway:**
> If delivery feels predictable, the Tech Lead is doing their job.

## Communication Style

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Reports status | Owns the narrative |
| Communicates blockers | Communicates before issues escalate |
| Focuses on details | Focuses on confidence and clarity |

---

## Under Pressure

| Software Engineer | Tech Lead |
|------------------|-----------|
| Pushes harder to finish | Adjusts scope to protect quality |
| Feels pressure | Absorbs pressure |
| Focuses on delivery of task | Focuses on safety of delivery |

---

## Relationship with the Manager

### Software Engineer

- Keeps manager informed
- Escalates when blocked
- Delivers task-level updates

### Tech Lead

- Reduces the number of decisions a manager must make
- Prevents emergencies
- Delivers confidence, not noise

---

## Mental Models

**Software Engineer**

> “If I deliver my work cleanly and communicate early, trust follows.”

**Tech Lead**

> “If delivery is boring and predictable, everything is working.”

---

## One-Sentence Summary

- **Software Engineer:** Delivers high-quality work and raises issues early.
- **Tech Lead:** Makes delivery predictable, calm, and safe — even under pressure.
